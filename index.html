            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to
            the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components:
            <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about
            React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components
            work in React Native.

          <p>
            React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for
            building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React
            Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
            you started or can serve as a refresher course.
          </p>
          <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
          <p>
            <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses
            cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
            names and a cafe to work in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
            write elements inside JavaScript like so:
            <span>&lt;Text\&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text\&gt;</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
            learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables
            inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for the cat,
            name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
            <span>&lt;Text\&gt;</span>
          </p>
          <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
          <p>
            <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
            configure how components render, state is like a component’s
            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
            your components memory!

          <h2 id="handling">handling text input <span>Chapter 4</span></h2>
          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called
            every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes
            a function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence
            "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
